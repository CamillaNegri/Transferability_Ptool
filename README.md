# Transferability_Ptool

A repository to test the transferability of a Bayesian Belief Network aimed at simulating stream phosphorus concentrations across diverse agricultural catchments. 

## Start here

- [SensitivityAnalysis.Rmd](https://github.com/CamillaNegri/Transferability_Ptool/blob/main/SensitivityAnalysis.Rmd) - a file detailing the code used for the sensitivity analysis on the continuous node "In stream P concentration mg L-1 month-1". The example is run using the Ptool_pointanddiffuse_v7_Dunleer.xdsl, but can be run with any Genie model.
