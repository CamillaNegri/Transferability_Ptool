# Transferability_Ptool

A repository to test the transferability of a Bayesian Belief Network aimed at simulating stream phosphorus concentrations across agricultural catchments with diverse hydrology. 

## Start here
This repository contains supplementary code and data for the paper titled "Transferability of a Bayesian Belief Network across diverse agricultural catchments using high-frequency hydrochemistry and land management data ". The models described in this paper were developed with GeNIe modeler version 2.4 (https://www.bayesfusion.com/) and the sensitivity analysis was implemented with rSMILE version 2.0.1, also from BayesFusion.

- Supplementary Information including the model parameterization and Supplementary Results are in the document [SupplementaryInformation.docx](https://github.com/CamillaNegri/Transferability_Ptool/blob/main/SupplementaryInformation.docx)

- Supplementary code is in the [SensitivityAnalysis.Rmd](https://github.com/CamillaNegri/Transferability_Ptool/blob/main/SensitivityAnalysis.Rmd) - a file detailing the code used for the sensitivity analysis on the continuous node "In stream P concentration mg L-1 month-1". The example is run using the [Ptool_pointanddiffuse_v7_Dunleer.xdsl](https://github.com/CamillaNegri/Transferability_Ptool/blob/main/Ptool_pointanddiffuse_v7_Dunleer.xdsl), but can be run with any GeNIe model (https://www.bayesfusion.com/) with appropriate adaptations.
